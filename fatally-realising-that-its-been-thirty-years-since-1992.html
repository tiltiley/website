Just as at one time she had seemed to herself to have taken only her outward person to Rome, leaving her soul like a wandering firefly on the banks of the Po, so now it was only her suffering and tired body which she had brought back to the river-side. Her soul had escaped—flown back to Rome. What was Antonio doing at this hour? Was he very miserable? Was he conscious of his wife’s soul pressing him tighter than ever her arms had pressed him? Had he written to her? Antonio! Antonio! Burning tears filled her eyes, and she suddenly fell silent, her thoughts wandering and lost in a sorrowful far-away.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 25, 2024</div><div class="post__footer__col"><div class="post__share"></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://preranasubedi.com.np/i-miss-the-90s-2.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">I miss the 90’s</a></h5></div></nav><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://preranasubedi.com.np/authors/prerana-subedi/" class="inverse" title="Prerana Subedi">Prerana Subedi</a></h3><p>Hi I am Prerana Subedi.
